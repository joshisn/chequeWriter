The "CheckWriter" program takes as input a dollar amount in numerical format (float). The program essentially “reads the numbers” and outputs a string of the numbers in word form. This is akin to a check writer (where you need an amount in both numbers and words), and thus the name.

Hello!
I am a self-taught programmer trying projects out as ways of learning how to become a better programmer everyday!
This is my first real end-to-end project per se.

To run the code, please ensure you have Python 3 installed on your computer, and that you are using Python 3 to run this program.

Also, please run the numToWords.py file for the full solution. You can go ahead and play around with the code in stringMan.py to see how the long numbers that you can input are broken into multiple sets of 3 or less. StringMan does not take any inputs, and you have to manually change the number in the first lines of code (variable called 'befDec') and run the code to see changes.
